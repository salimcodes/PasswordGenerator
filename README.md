## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up the project and create a virtual environment to work on the Password Generator application.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/password-generator.git
   cd password-generator
   
2. **Create a virtual environment:**

I recommend creating a virtual environment to manage the dependencies of this project and ensure isolation from other projects.

On macOS and Linux:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

On windows
```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

After activation, your command prompt should show the name of the virtual environment in the prompt, indicating that you are now working within the virtual environment.

3. Install project dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the Password Generator application, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have activated the virtual environment (if you haven't already done so):

On macOS and Linux:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
On Windows:
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```
2. Start the Flask development server:
```
python app.py
```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

4. Use the form on the webpage to specify the password length and choose the types of characters you want in the generated password (digits, letters, symbols).

5. Click on the "Generate Password" button to get a password that meets your requirements. The first and last characters of the password will always be letters if you select the "Include Letters" option.

6. To stop the Flask development server, press Ctrl + C in the terminal.

Remember to deactivate the virtual environment when you are done working on the project:

```
deactivate
```
